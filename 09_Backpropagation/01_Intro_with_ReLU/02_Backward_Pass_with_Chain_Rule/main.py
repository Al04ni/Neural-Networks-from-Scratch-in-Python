# Calculates the gradient of ReLUâ€™s output with respect to z during backpropagation.
# If z > 0, the ReLU derivative is 1, meaning the loss gradient will fully propagate back.
# If z <= 0, the derivative is 0, stopping the gradient from passing back through z, effectively "blocking" updates to earlier weights.
# This calculation uses the chain rule: we multiply the incoming gradient (dvalue) by the local gradient of ReLU to get the overall gradient with respect to z.
